1. Create Multiple Passwords with Varying Complexity
Examples:

Weak: password123

Medium: Summer2025

Strong: 5uM!eR@2o25

Very Strong: Xy7#L!9pQ$3r@Kz

2. Use Uppercase, Lowercase, Numbers, Symbols, and Length Variations
Password	Length	Upper	Lower	Number	Symbol
password123	11	No	Yes	Yes	No
Summer2025	10	Yes	Yes	Yes	No
5uM!eR@2o25	12	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes
Xy7#L!9pQ$3r@Kz	15	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes

3. Test Each Password on a Password Strength Checker
You can use:

https://password.kaspersky.com/

 4. Note Scores and Feedback from the Tool
Password	Time to Crack	Feedback
password123	< 1 second	Too common, easily guessed
Summer2025	Few hours	Better, but predictable
5uM!eR@2o25	Thousands of years	Strong, mixed characters
Xy7#L!9pQ$3r@Kz	Millions of years	Excellent, very secure

5.Use at least 12-16 characters

Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols

Avoid dictionary words or common patterns

Don't reuse passwords across sites

Use passphrases or a password manager

6. Tips Learned from the Evaluation
Longer = Stronger

Randomness is critical

Common words or sequences reduce security

Combining length + complexity makes the password significantly harder to crack

Avoid personal info (e.g., birthdate, names)
7. Research Common Password Attacks
Brute Force Attack: Tries every possible combination
Dictionary Attack: Uses lists of common words or leaked passwords
Phishing: Tricks users into revealing passwords
Credential Stuffing: Uses leaked passwords from other sites
Keylogging: Captures what users type
 8. Summary: How Password Complexity Affects Security
Password complexity increases the number of possible combinations, which exponentially increases the time and effort required to crack them.

A short/simple password (like "hello123") can be cracked in seconds.

A complex one with mixed characters and enough length (like Gx@7zL!4#9qT) can take millions of years even with modern computing.
